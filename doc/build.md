# How to generate everything from source

This document describes the procedures to build all the components of zeST from source code.

Two procedures are available:

 - a fully automatic procedure if you are fine with the default settings in all components;
 - a detailed step-by-step manual procedure if you are interested in tweaking some configuration files or just learn about zeST's internals.

## Required material

You’ll need:

 - Vivado and Vitis Embedded Development. The version I used is [2024.1](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2024-1.html).
 - The [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/) assembler, compiled with M68k backend and Motorola syntax (tested on version 1.9d)
 - required command line tools:
   - wget
   - git
   - gcc
   - g++
   - make
   - device-tree-compiler
   - u-boot-tools
   - flex
   - bison
 - Development libraries:
   - uuid-dev
   - gnutls-dev
   - libssl-dev
   - libtinfo5

My build system is a Debian bullseye Linux system, but I believe any GNU/Linux system will do.

This documentation assumes the following file paths:

- The Xilinx tools (Vivado, SDK) installation directory is `/opt/Xilinx`.
- All source files and git clones are in `$HOME/src`.
- Your Vivado project is in a subdirectory of `zest/vivado`. The project directory name depends on your FPGA board.

## Fix rlwrap

The current version (2024.1) of the Xilinx tools requires to update one of the internally used tools.
If not already done, the procedure is the following (as root):

    # apt install rlwrap
    # cd /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2024.1/bin/unwrapped/lnx64.o
    # rm rlwrap
    # ln -s /usr/bin/rlwrap .

Quit the root session and go back to your normal user session.

## Get the zeST source code

Issue those commands:

    $ cd $HOME/src
    $ git clone --depth=1 --recursive https://github.com/zerkman/zest.git

# Automatically build everything

You can build a whole zeST distribution archive with the following commands:

    $ cd $HOME/src/zest/setup
    $ ./build.sh

Now go get a cup of tea and wait for the build process to finish.

# Manual build procedure

The following is a detailed procedure of the different zeST build steps.
If you are only interested in the resulting build elements, you can follow the [automatic build procedure](#automatically-build-everything).

## Create the Vivado project and generate the bitstream file

### Create the Vivado project

In the `zest/vivado` directory, you will find a `create_project.sh` shell script and different TCL script files, each one corresponding to a specific FPGA board. You will need to identify the file that corresponds to your hardware.

If, for instance, you choose to create the project corresponding to the `zest_z7lite_7010.tcl` file, enter the command:

    $ ./create_project.sh zest_z7lite_7010

This will create a `zest_z7lite_7010` directory with all the project files in it.

Now your Vivado project setup is complete.

### Generate the bitstream file

Open the project in Vivado.
From the left panel, in **Program and debug**, click **Generate Bitstream**. The process will take a few minutes to complete.

When the generation is complete, you need to copy the bitstream file to the zeST setup directory. If, depending on your FPGA board, your Vivado project name is for instance `zest_z7lite_7010`, the command will be:

    $ cp $HOME/src/zest/vivado/zest_z7lite_7010/zest_z7lite_7010.runs/impl_1/zest_top.bit $HOME/src/zest/setup

### Export the hardware

Click **File -> Export -> Export Hardware**. This opens the *Export Hardware Platform* dialog.

- On the first page of the dialog, click **Next**.
- As platform properties, choose **Pre-synthesis**, then click **Next**.
- Now you can choose the export file name. The default is `$HOME/src/zest/vivado/zest_z7lite_7010/zest_top.xsa`, assuming your Vivado project name is `zest_z7lite_7010`. Just leave it as is and click **Next**.
- Click **Finish**.

You have now generated the platform file to generate the bootloaders, as well as the Linux device tree.

You may now exit Vivado.

## Build the device tree

Before going any further, make sure you correctly performed the [required fix for the current version of the Xilinx tools](#fix-rlwrap).

### Create the device tree source

Get the device tree source code, at the same version as your Vivado/Vitis setup.

    $ cd $HOME/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/device-tree-xlnx.git
    $ cd device-tree-xlnx
    $ git checkout xilinx-v2024.1

Start XSCT:

    $ /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2024.1/bin/xsct

Open the XSA file you exported from Vivado, provided the paths are the same as the previous steps:

    xsct% hsi open_hw_design $::env(HOME)/src/zest/vivado/zest_z7lite_7010/zest_top.xsa

Setup the path where you fetched the `device-tree-xlnx` repository:

    xsct% hsi set_repo_path $::env(HOME)/src/device-tree-xlnx

Create SW design and setup CPU:

    xsct% hsi create_sw_design device-tree -os device_tree -proc ps7_cortexa9_0

Generate DTS/DTSI files to specified folder:

    xsct% hsi generate_target -dir $::env(HOME)/src/zest/setup/dt

Exit XSCT:

    xsct% exit

### Create the device tree blob

You will need the specific `zest.dts` device tree source file for your board.
All zeST's board-specific device tree source files are in a dedicated subdirectory in `$HOME/src/zest/setup`.
For instance, for the Z7-Lite board, issue the command:

    $ cp setup/z7lite/zest.dts setup/dt

Now, you can build the device tree blob:

    $ cd setup/dt
    $ cpp -nostdinc -I include -I arch -undef -x assembler-with-cpp zest.dts > devicetree.dts
    $ dtc -I dts -O dtb -i . -o ../devicetree.dtb devicetree.dts

This generates the `$HOME/src/zest/setup/devicetree.dtb` device tree blob file.


## Build the first stage bootloader

The generation of the first stage bootloader (FSBL) is done in XSCT.

Start XSCT:

    $ /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2024.1/bin/xsct

Open the hardware design from the XSA file you exported from Vivado:

    xsct% set hwdsgn [hsi open_hw_design $::env(HOME)/src/zest/vivado/zest_z7lite_7010/zest_top.xsa]

Generate and build the FSBL into a `$HOME/src/fsbl` directory:

    xsct% hsi generate_app -hw $hwdsgn -os standalone -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -app zynq_fsbl -compile -sw fsbl -dir $::env(HOME)/src/fsbl

Exit XSCT:

    xsct% exit

Copy the FSBL executable file to the `setup` directory:

    $ cp $HOME/src/fsbl/executable.elf $HOME/src/zest/setup/fsbl.elf

Remove the `$HOME/src/fsbl` as it is no longer needed:

    $ rm -rf $HOME/src/fsbl

<!-- For early information when booting, you may add `FSBL_DEBUG_INFO` in the C preprocessor defines in the fsbl project properties. -->


## Build the Linux filesystem

This process will create the whole Linux filesystem for your Zynq board, as well as the build toolchain that can be used for builing the Linux kernel, u-boot and the userland applications.

This procedure has been successfully tested using buildroot version 2023.11.1.
It should most probably work on more recent versions.

### Buildroot setup

Fetch the buildroot sources:

    $ cd $HOME/src
    $ wget https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2023.11.1.tar.xz
    $ tar xf buildroot-2023.11.1.tar.xz

Now a bit of configuration must be done. Issue the commands:

    $ cd buildroot-2023.11.1
    $ cp $HOME/src/zest/setup/defconfig/buildroot configs/zest_defconfig
    $ make zest_defconfig

You may want to configure some extra packages to install on your Linux system.
In that case, type `make menuconfig`, then in the menu go to `Target packages` and select the packages you want.
When your choice is made, exit the menu, and save your settings when asked.

When everything is set up, type `make` to build everything. This will take quite a while.

### Build the zeST binary executable file

During the Buildroot build process, a full-featured cross GCC toolchain is also created, which allows to build Linux binaries for the board's ARM processor. We will use it to build the zeST binary executable file.

In `$HOME/src/zest/linux`, edit the `Makefile` file. You should find a commented out line of the form:

    #export PATH:=$(HOME)/src/buildroot-2023.11.1/output/host/bin:$(PATH)

If you installed Buildroot at the default location `$HOME/src/buildroot-2023.11.1`, you may just uncomment this line my removing the leading `#` comment symbol. Otherwise, modify the line to point to the location of your Buildroot toolchain.

Save the modified file, close your file editor and type the commands:

    $ cd $HOME/src/zest/linux
    $ make

This will generate a `zeST` binary executable file.

### Filesystem customisation

After the Buildroot build, a base version of the root filesystem has been created. We need to patch it a bit, so that the booting process automatically mounts the SD card partition (to get access to the ROM and floppy image files), then runs the zeST executable file.

The customisation is done by a `buildroot_post_build.sh` script file from the `zest/setup` directory. Run it from the Buildroot main directory, and build the root filesystem again (this time should be very quick):

    $ cd $HOME/src/buildroot-2023.11.1
    $ sh $HOME/src/zest/setup/buildroot_post_build.sh
    $ make

The Linux filesystem image will be created as the `buildroot-2023.11.1/output/images/rootfs.cpio.uboot` file. Copy it to your `setup` dir:

    $ cp output/images/rootfs.cpio.uboot $HOME/src/zest/setup/rootfs.ub

## Toolchain setup

During the Buildroot build process, a full-featured cross GCC toolchain is also created, which allows to build Linux binaries for the board's ARM processor. This includes u-boot (the bootloader), the Linux kernel and the zeST manager.

For the following steps (u-boot and Linux kernel), you may set up the environement to use the buildroot cross compilation toolchain:

    $ export ARCH=arm
    $ export CROSS_COMPILE=$HOME/src/buildroot-2023.11.1/output/host/bin/arm-linux-

## Build the u-boot bootloader

Get the source code and issue the following configurations:

    $ cd $HOME/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx.git
    $ cd u-boot-xlnx
    $ git checkout xilinx-v2024.1
    $ make xilinx_zynq_virt_defconfig
    $ sed -i 's/^\(CONFIG_DEFAULT_DEVICE_TREE\)=.*/\1=""/g' .config
    $ sed -i 's/^\(CONFIG_BAUDRATE\)=.*/\1=921600/g' .config
    $ sed -i 's/^\(CONFIG_BOOTDELAY\)=.*/\1=0/g' .config

Copy the required files:

    $ cp $HOME/src/zest/setup/devicetree.dtb arch/arm/dts/unset.dtb
    $ mkdir -p board/xilinx/zynq/custom_hw_platform
    $ cp $HOME/src/zest/vivado/zest_z7lite_7010/ps7_init_gpl.[ch] board/xilinx/zynq/custom_hw_platform

Build u-boot

    $ make

Copy the `u-boot.elf` file to the zeST `setup` directory:

    $ cp u-boot.elf $HOME/src/zest/setup

## Make BOOT.bin

You need to make a `BOOT.bin` file that embeds the FSBL, the bitstream, u-boot and a device tree file for u-boot.

If you have performed the previous steps correctly, you should now have the following files in your `$HOME/src/zest/setup` directory:

- `devicetree.dtb`
- `fsbl.elf`
- `zest_top.bit`
- `u-boot.elf`

In `$HOME/src/zest/setup` create a `boot.bif` text file containing the following:

    //arch = zynq; split = false; format = BIN
    the_ROM_image:
    {
            [bootloader]fsbl.elf
            zest_top.bit
            u-boot.elf
            devicetree.dtb
    }

The file describes the proper pathnames for the different required files.

Issue the command:

    $ /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2024.1/bin/bootgen -arch zynq -image boot.bif -o BOOT.bin

If everything went correctly, now you’ve got the required `BOOT.bin` file.

## Make boot.scr

You need a `boot.scr` boot script file for u-boot. It contains a list of commands to boot Linux, and setup the kernel accordingly.

Create a `boot.cmd` file with the contents:

    setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,921600 rw earlyprintk uio_pdrv_genirq.of_id=generic-uio rootwait
    fatload mmc 0 0x8000 uImage
    fatload mmc 0 0x800000 devicetree.dtb
    fatload mmc 0 0x900000 rootfs.ub
    bootm 0x8000 0x900000 0x800000

Then create `boot.scr` from it, placing it in your `setup` directory:

    mkimage -A arm -O linux -C none -T script -a 0 -e 0 -n "boot script" -d boot.cmd $HOME/src/zest/setup/boot.scr


## Build the Linux kernel

Get the Linux source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git
    $ cd linux-xlnx
    $ git checkout xilinx-v2024.1

Configure the kernel:

    $ cp $HOME/src/zest/setup/linux_defconfig arch/arm/configs/zest_defconfig
    $ make zest_defconfig

Build the kernel and copy the image file to your zeST `setup` directory:

    $ make UIMAGE_LOADADDR=0x8000 uImage
    $ cp arch/arm/boot/uImage $HOME/src/zest/setup
